HLG Reference Paper White Calculator

Web-based tool to calculate the recommended diffuse white luminance for HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) content.

## How it Works

The calculator uses formulas and principles derived from:

*   **ITU-R BT.2100**: Image parameter values for high dynamic range television.
*   **ITU-R BT.2390**: High dynamic range television for production and international programme exchange.
*   **ITU-R BT.2408**: Guidance for operational practices in HDR television production.

You can input:
1.  **Viewing Environment:**
    *   Room Illuminance (Lux) and Surround Reflectivity, OR
    *   Ambient Surround Luminance (cd/m²) directly.
2.  **Display Peak Luminance** (cd/m²).
3.  **(Advanced)** The HLG signal level (%) that should represent paper white (defaults to the ITU recommendation of 75%).
